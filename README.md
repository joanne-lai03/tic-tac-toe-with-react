# Tic Tac Toe with React

This is a starter project that uses webpack to transpile and bundle ES6 React code. 

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/public`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.
